# Graceful Error Handling and Recovery System

This document describes the comprehensive graceful error handling and recovery system implemented for the Reality Checker WhatsApp bot, addressing task 6 requirements for Redis performance optimization.

## Overview

The graceful error handling system provides:

- **Fallback mechanisms** for Redis unavailability
- **Graceful degradation** for rate limiting without Redis
- **Automatic recovery detection** and service restoration
- **Comprehensive error logging** with actionable diagnostics
- **Continuous webhook processing** during Redis outages
- **Automatic recovery** when services are restored

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **GracefulErrorHandler** - Main orchestrator for error handling and recovery
2. **MemoryFallbackCache** - In-memory cache for Redis fallback operations
3. **BasicRateLimiter** - In-memory rate limiter for Redis fallback
4. **ErrorDiagnosticsCollector** - Comprehensive error diagnostics and logging
5. **Service Health Monitoring** - Continuous monitoring and recovery detection

### Service Status States

- **HEALTHY** - Service is fully operational
- **DEGRADED** - Service has issues but is partially functional
- **UNAVAILABLE** - Service is completely unavailable
- **RECOVERING** - Service is in recovery process

### Fallback Modes

- **NONE** - No fallback needed (service healthy)
- **MEMORY_CACHE** - Using in-memory cache instead of Redis
- **BASIC_RATE_LIMITING** - Using in-memory rate limiting
- **SIMPLIFIED_PROCESSING** - Reduced functionality mode
- **EMERGENCY_MODE** - Minimal functionality only

## Implementation Details

### Requirement 6.1: Fallback Mechanisms for Redis Unavailability

The system provides multiple fallback mechanisms when Redis becomes unavailable:

#### Memory Cache Fallback
```python
# Automatic fallback to in-memory cache
result = await graceful_handler.redis_get_with_fallback("cache_key")
success = await graceful_handler.redis_set_with_fallback("cache_key", "value", 300)
```

Features:
- LRU eviction policy
- TTL support
- Size limits to prevent memory exhaustion
- Hit/miss statistics

#### Rate Limiting Fallback
```python
# Automatic fallback to in-memory rate limiting
allowed, reason = await graceful_handler.rate_limit_check_with_fallback(
    "user_id", limit=10, window=60
)
```

Features:
- Per-user rate limiting
- Sliding window implementation
- Automatic cleanup of old entries
- Same API as Redis-based rate limiting

### Requirement 6.2: Graceful Degradation for Rate Limiting

When Redis is unavailable, the system automatically switches to in-memory rate limiting:

1. **Transparent Fallback** - Applications continue to work without code changes
2. **Consistent API** - Same interface for Redis and memory-based rate limiting
3. **Performance Optimization** - Memory-based limiting is faster for small scales
4. **Automatic Recovery** - Switches back to Redis when available

### Requirement 6.3: Automatic Recovery Detection and Service Restoration

The system continuously monitors service health and attempts automatic recovery:

#### Health Monitoring
- **Continuous Monitoring** - Background health checks every 30 seconds
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern** - Prevents cascading failures
- **Exponential Backoff** - Intelligent retry timing
- **Recovery Detection** - Automatic detection when services are restored

#### Recovery Process
1. **Failure Detection** - Service marked as unavailable
2. **Fallback Activation** - Appropriate fallback mode enabled
3. **Recovery Attempts** - Periodic attempts to restore service
4. **Service Restoration** - Automatic switch back to primary service
5. **Fallback Cleanup** - Memory caches cleared, normal operation resumed

### Requirement 6.4: Comprehensive Error Logging with Actionable Diagnostics

The error diagnostics system provides detailed troubleshooting information:

#### System Metrics Collection
- CPU usage and load average
- Memory usage and availability
- Disk usage
- Network connections and open files

#### Service Diagnostics
- Service availability status
- Response times and latency
- Connection pool metrics
- Circuit breaker states
- Error counts and patterns

#### Actionable Steps Generation
```python
diagnostic = await collect_error_diagnostics(
    error, context, correlation_id, DiagnosticLevel.DETAILED
)

# Provides specific troubleshooting steps:
# 1. Check Redis server status: `redis-cli ping`
# 2. Verify Redis connection configuration
# 3. Check network connectivity to Redis server
# etc.
```

#### Resolution Suggestions
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Resource scaling suggestions
- Configuration improvements
- Monitoring and alerting setup

### Requirement 6.5: Webhook Processing Continues During Redis Outages

The webhook handler is designed to continue processing even when Redis is unavailable:

#### Immediate Response Pattern
- Webhook acknowledgment within 500ms regardless of Redis status
- Background processing continues with fallback mechanisms
- Error diagnostics collected asynchronously

#### Validation Cache Fallback
- Memory-based validation caching when Redis unavailable
- Maintains performance during Redis outages
- Automatic cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### Requirement 6.6: Automatic Recovery When Services Are Restored

The system automatically detects and handles service recovery:

#### Recovery Detection
- Continuous health monitoring
- Automatic service restoration detection
- Graceful transition back to primary services

#### Recovery Actions
1. **Service Status Update** - Mark service as healthy
2. **Fallback Deactivation** - Disable fallback modes
3. **Cache Cleanup** - Clear memory caches to prevent stale data
4. **Metrics Recording** - Log successful recovery
5. **Alert Notifications** - Notify administrators of recovery

## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration

```python
from app.utils.graceful_error_handling import get_graceful_error_handler

# Initialize graceful error handler
handler = get_graceful_error_handler()
await handler.start_monitoring()

# Use with automatic fallback
result = await handler.execute_with_fallback(
    primary_operation,
    "service_name",
    fallback_operation
)
```

### Caching with Fallback

```python
from app.services.caching_service import get_caching_service

# Caching service automatically uses graceful error handling
cache = get_caching_service()
value = await cache.get("key")  # Automatically falls back to memory
await cache.set("key", "value", 300)  # Automatically falls back to memory
```

### Rate Limiting with Fallback

```python
from app.middleware.rate_limiting import RateLimiter

# Rate limiter automatically uses graceful error handling
limiter = RateLimiter(config)
allowed, reason = await limiter.is_allowed_async("user_id")
```

## Configuration

### Recovery Configuration

```python
config = RecoveryConfig(
    max_failure_count=5,           # Failures before marking unavailable
    recovery_check_interval=30,    # Seconds between recovery attempts
    recovery_timeout=300,          # Max time for recovery attempts
    exponential_backoff_base=2.0,  # Backoff multiplier
    max_backoff_delay=300,         # Max delay between attempts
    health_check_timeout=5.0       # Timeout for health checks
)
```

### Memory Cache Configuration

```python
cache = MemoryFallbackCache(
    max_size=1000,      # Maximum cache entries
    default_ttl=300     # Default TTL in seconds
)
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Status Monitoring

```python
# Get comprehensive system status
status = await handler.get_comprehensive_status()

# Check individual service status
redis_status = handler.get_service_status("redis")
is_available = handler.is_service_available("redis")
fallback_mode = handler.get_fallback_mode("redis")
```

### Error Diagnostics

```python
# Collect comprehensive error diagnostics
diagnostic = await collect_error_diagnostics(
    error, 
    context, 
    correlation_id, 
    DiagnosticLevel.COMPREHENSIVE
)

# Get error summary
summary = collector.get_error_summary(hours=24)
```

### Metrics and Alerts

The system provides metrics for:
- Service availability percentages
- Fallback activation counts
- Recovery success/failure rates
- Memory cache hit/miss rates
- Error frequencies by category
- System resource utilization

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive unit tests covering:
