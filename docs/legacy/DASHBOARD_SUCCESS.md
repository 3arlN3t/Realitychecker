6. **Error Handling** with retry functionality

### 🚀 **How to Use:**

#### Quick Start:

```bash
# Method 1: Use the startup script
./start_unified_dashboard.sh

- CPU Usage: Current percentage
- Requests per Minute: Live rate

### 🔧 **Technical Details:**

#### Files Created/Modified:

- ✅ `templates/dashboard.html` - Unified dashboard template
- ✅ `app/main.py` - Added unified dashboard route
- ✅ `start_unified_dashboard.sh` - Easy startup script
- ✅ `.env.dashboard` - Development environment config
- ✅ `test_unified_dashboard.py` - Verification script

#### Key Features:

- **No React Build Process** - Single HTML file with embedded JavaScript
- **Material Design UI** - Professional, modern interface
- **Auto-refresh** - Updates every 30 seconds automatically
- **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks and retry functionality
- **Development Mode** - Bypasses authentication for easy development

### 🎯 **Problem Solved:**

#### Before:

- ❌ Separate React dashboard requiring build process
- ❌ Empty/unused sections in layout
- ❌ Performance metrics not prominently displayed
- ❌ Complex deployment with two systems

#### After:

- ✅ Single unified dashboard served by FastAPI
- ✅ Performance metrics prominently displayed at top
- ✅ Clean, efficient layout with no wasted space
- ✅ Simple deployment - one server serves everything

### 🧪 **Verification:**

All tests pass successfully:

```
✅ Dashboard HTML loads correctly
✅ Health check: healthy
✅ Dashboard overview API working
✅ Detailed health API working
✅ Real-time metrics API working
```

### 🔒 **Security Note:**

The dashboard currently runs in development mode (`DEVELOPMENT_MODE=true`) which bypasses authentication. For production use:

1. Set `DEVELOPMENT_MODE=false`
2. Configure proper JWT authentication
3. Set up admin user credentials
4. Enable HTTPS and security headers

### 🎊 **Result:**

You now have a **single, unified backend dashboard** that:

- Displays performance metrics prominently (as requested)
- Shows real-time system health and metrics
- Updates automatically every 30 seconds
- Handles errors gracefully
- Looks professional with Material Design
- Works on all devices
- Requires no separate build process

**The empty section you wanted to remove is gone, and Performance Metrics are now prominently displayed exactly where you wanted them!**
