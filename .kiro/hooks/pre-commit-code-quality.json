Code Formatting (Black)\n- Run `black --check {file_path}` to see if formatting is needed\n- If formatting is needed, run `black {file_path}` to apply formatting\n- Report what was formatted\n\n## 2. Linting (Flake8)\n- Run `flake8 {file_path}` to check for style and quality issues\n- Report any violations found\n- For common issues, suggest specific fixes\n\n## 3. Type Checking (MyPy)\n- Run `mypy {file_path}` to check type annotations\n- Report any type errors or missing annotations\n- Suggest improvements for type safety\n\n## 4. Summary\n- Provide a concise summary of all issues found and actions taken\n- If no issues found, confirm the code meets quality standards\n- Use emojis for visual clarity: ‚úÖ (success), ‚ö†Ô∏è (warning), ‚ùå (error), üîß (fixed)\n\n**Important**: Only process the specific file that triggered the hook. Be efficient and focus on actionable feedback.",
