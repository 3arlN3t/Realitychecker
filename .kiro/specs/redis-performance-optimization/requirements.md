# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Reality Checker WhatsApp bot is experiencing critical performance and reliability issues that are impacting user experience and system stability. The primary issues are:

1. Redis connectivity failures causing rate limiting to fall back to in-memory storage
2. Extremely slow webhook response times (14+ seconds) causing Twilio timeouts
3. Performance monitoring alerts indicating system stress

These issues need to be resolved to ensure reliable service delivery and prevent user frustration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Redis Connectivity Reliability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Redis connectivity to be reliable and resilient, so that rate limiting and caching work consistently without fallbacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish a stable Redis connection within 5 seconds
2. WHEN Redis connection is lost THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
3. WHEN Redis is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating with graceful degradation
4. WHEN Redis connection is restored THEN the system SHALL resume normal caching and rate limiting operations
5. IF Redis connection fails during startup THEN the system SHALL log detailed connection diagnostics
6. WHEN Redis connection pool is exhausted THEN the system SHALL handle connection timeouts gracefully

### Requirement 2: Webhook Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a WhatsApp user, I want my messages to be processed quickly, so that I receive timely responses without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a webhook request is received THEN the system SHALL respond to Twilio within 2 seconds
2. WHEN processing a text message THEN the system SHALL complete validation and queuing within 500ms
3. WHEN processing a PDF attachment THEN the system SHALL acknowledge receipt within 1 second and process asynchronously
4. WHEN multiple requests arrive simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle them concurrently without blocking
5. IF message processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL still acknowledge receipt to Twilio promptly
6. WHEN webhook validation fails THEN the system SHALL return error responses within 100ms

### Requirement 3: Background Task Processing

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want message processing to be decoupled from webhook responses, so that Twilio timeouts are prevented and system throughput is maximized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a webhook is received THEN the system SHALL immediately queue the message for background processing
2. WHEN background processing starts THEN the system SHALL track task status and completion
3. WHEN background tasks fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN the task queue is full THEN the system SHALL apply backpressure and reject new requests gracefully
5. IF background processing takes too long THEN the system SHALL send timeout notifications to users
6. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL prioritize webhook acknowledgment over background processing

### Requirement 4: Performance Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive performance monitoring, so that I can identify and resolve performance issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN webhook response time exceeds 1 second THEN the system SHALL log a warning with detailed timing information
2. WHEN webhook response time exceeds 3 seconds THEN the system SHALL trigger a critical alert
3. WHEN Redis operations fail THEN the system SHALL track failure rates and alert when threshold is exceeded
4. WHEN background task queue depth exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
5. IF system resources (CPU, memory) exceed 80% THEN the system SHALL log performance warnings
6. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide actionable diagnostic information

### Requirement 5: Connection Pool Management

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want efficient connection pool management for Redis and database connections, so that resource utilization is optimized and connection exhaustion is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize connection pools with appropriate sizing
2. WHEN connection pool utilization exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL log warnings and consider scaling
3. WHEN connections are idle for extended periods THEN the system SHALL recycle them to maintain pool health
4. WHEN connection pool is exhausted THEN the system SHALL queue requests with appropriate timeouts
5. IF database connections fail THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns
6. WHEN connection pools are under stress THEN the system SHALL provide detailed metrics for troubleshooting

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling and automatic recovery mechanisms, so that temporary failures don't cause permanent service disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement fallback mechanisms without service interruption
2. WHEN webhook processing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL still acknowledge receipt to Twilio
3. WHEN background tasks fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to maximum attempts
4. WHEN system resources are exhausted THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error context for debugging
6. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically resume normal operations
