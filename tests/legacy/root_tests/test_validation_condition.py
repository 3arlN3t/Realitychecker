Test the validation condition logic used in the webhook endpoint.

This script validates the specific text length validation logic:
sanitized_body and text_length < MIN_TEXT_LENGTH

The condition fails (raises 400 error) when:
- sanitized_body is truthy (not empty after sanitization)
- AND text_length < MIN_TEXT_LENGTH (20 characters)
